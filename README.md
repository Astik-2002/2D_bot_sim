This is a 2D physics and lidar simulator for experimenting with different path-planning/control algorithms for differential drive robots.

The physics for bot has been borrowed from this repository (https://github.com/zainkhan-afk/Differential-Drive-Robot-Navigation/tree/main)
Here's the simulator in action:

###TODO###:
Enable a ros2 interface so the simulation physics and control can run as one node, and path planning can run as a different node
